# minder

An app for The Mindscape discord server.

## setup

1.  **clone/open project**: ensure you are in the `minder` directory.
2.  **install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **configure environment**:
    - copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
    - fill in your `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `CLIENT_ID`.
    - (optional) fill in `GUILD_ID` for faster command registration during development.

## running the app

1.  **register commands**:
    run this once (or whenever you change commands):
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```
    if you provided a `GUILD_ID`, commands will appear immediately in that server. if not, it may take up to an hour to appear globally.

2.  **start the app**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## test usage

in Discord, type:
`/say message:Hello World`

the app will reply with an ephemeral message "Hello World".

## process management (avoid zombies)

### correctly stopping the app
to stop the app, click inside the terminal running it and press **`Ctrl + C`**. This sends a shutdown signal to the process.

### to kill all running app processes:
```bash
# Linux/Mac
pkill -f "node index.js"
```
